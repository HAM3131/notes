## Intro

In media and popular discourse, immigration is a demonized subject which can be the target of a fearmongering and often used as a scapegoat for anything from unemployment to crime, and then there is also just outright racism. Here I hope to do research into the various impacts of immigration. I want to look specifically at the economy, crime, and illegal immigration. I will first detail my opinion on what should be done regarding immigration before the research, and at the end I will take a look at how my outlook has changed. After my initial opinion, I will write a short section listing the talking points I have heard before as a place to start my research from.

## Opinion Before Research

What I often hear about modern immigration is fearmongering that immigrants will make the US a worse place, and this is in large part a function of Donald Trump. Whether it is immigrants from the south, or people coming from Muslim--and therefore 'terrorist' countries--they are met with a fear that doesn't make sense to me when it comes from a country that is founded on immigrants and opportunity for them. Especially in the present day where the US is an economic superpower, only rivaled by China, a country with triple the population, I cannot see a reason to turn away the people who want to come here and better their lives.  

I believe that the immigration process should be made simpler and more efficient so that more of the people coming to the US can go through legal channels, and we can accept more immigrants. It is my understanding that not only would this help our economy, it would foster the growth of new ideas and opportunities for all living here. It would also allow those seeking life in the US to live the 'American Dream' while doing a better job to help the people fleeing hardship around the world than forcing them to remain where they are, in situations that are no fault of their own.
