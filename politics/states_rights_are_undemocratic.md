# States' Rights are Undemocratic

I want to look and see if there is any good writing on this already, but fundamentally the idea of states' rights is undemocratic. I want to trace the history of compromise that lead to the creation of the Senate and states' rights as a mechanism to allow slaveowners to keep their slaves while staying in the Union.

Additionally, I want to express the idea that when there is a law that exists on the federal level, a desire to return that law to the states is inherently undemocratic. It is akin to reaching an agreement as team by vote, then when the decision does not go your way, splitting the team into smaller groups in the hope that your subdivision will do what you want. There is no coherent reason why a state is better able to make policy than the federal government. At least not one that would equally contend that local government is better than states. And then if you are passing decisions to local government, what makes local government know better what is best for your family than the head of the house? The logical conclusion of the argument is a dissolution of any law by which you do not want to comply, and it disregards the neccesity of a governing body to weigh the interest of the people and hold them in balance.
