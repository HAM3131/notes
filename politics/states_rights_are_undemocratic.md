# States' Rights are Undemocratic

I want to look and see if there is any good writing on this already, but fundamentally the idea of states' rights is undemocratic. I want to trace the history of compromise that lead to the creation of the Senate and states' rights as a mechanism to allow slaveowners to keep their slaves while staying in the Union.

Additionally, I want to express the idea that when there is a law that exists on the federal level, a desire to return that law to the states is inherently undemocratic. It is akin to reaching an agreement as team by vote, then when the decision does not go your way, splitting the team into smaller groups in the hope that your subdivision will do what you want. There is no coherent reason why a state is better able to make policy than the federal government. At least not one that would equally contend that local government is better than states. And then if you are passing decisions to local government, what makes local government know better what is best for your family than the head of the house? The logical conclusion of the argument is a dissolution of any law by which you do not want to comply, and it disregards the neccesity of a governing body to weigh the interest of the people and hold them in balance.

## History of states' rights and compromise

[brief introduction to history]

### The senate

[information about the creation of the senate and why it was made as a compromise]

### Slavery

[context as to why state compromises]

### Other historical "states' rights" issues

[abortion has constantly been pushed as a states right's issue. Similarly, civil rights have been the same. Some states have recently argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by states]

## Arguments for states' rights

[brief introduction to arguments for states' rights and list all of the ones that will be covered]

### More responsive to the people

[Search for evidence on if this is true. But if it is, by the same vein that state governments are more responsive to the people, so are town or city local governments. And within these structures, the neighborhood you live in and HOA would be more responsive to your needs, and you yourself more responsive than them. This is an argument for endless delegation to the point where every individual would live by his own set or rules]

### Avoid "tyranny of the majority"

[The alternative to a tyranny of the majority is a tyranny of the minority]

### Provides a "testing grounds" for policies

[look for any examples of policies that are treated this way. Even if this is true though, it is not an argument against federal administration of this testing. In fact, the federal government would be better suited to administer structured policy testing across states]

### Promotes unity by allowing those with differing policies to get their way

[explain how actually the opposite is true. People living under different sets of laws become more divided]

### Less bloat and bureaucracy

[when you do everything 50 times, there is in fact more bloat. Also mention that the more local the government, the more common corruption is due to bribes]
