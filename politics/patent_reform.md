# Patent Reform
The basic idea here is that patents are pretty dumb as they exist today. The world is better when more people have access to the amazing things that technology can offer, and patents only serve as a stumbling block to that end. Expensive medicines that can save lives are sold at unbelievably high prices because a pharmaceutical company owns the patent and has no incentive to lower prices. The demand is inelastic when your life is on the line. Although I believe in a perfect world I think that patents should not exist at all, within the framework of the world today my initial thought is that changing patents from an exclusive right to produce and sell a good into a royalty system which reduces in payout over time (ie, 10% royalty for a 20 year period which reduces in payout by 0.5% annually).

Effort also needs to be put into reforming the patent system to prevent patent trolls from filing broad, over-reaching patents in an attempt to create a legal web which they can make money on through law suits.
