# Trans Be Like

## Talking Points
 - Less than 100 NCAA trans women athletes (Newsweek)
 - "Save Women's Sports" identified only 5 transgender athletes in K-12 sports on girls' teams (Newsweek)
 - 97% of transitioner are happy with their choice (GenderGP)
 - Puberty blockers are safe and have been used since the 80s (Cedars Sinai)
 - ~0.5% of the population (USA Facts)
 - Intersex people make up about 1.7% of the population (OHCR)

## Counterpoints
### Religious Complaints
 - "Against God's creation"
   - God's creation exists in spectrums (HRC)
   - "But rather than writing Genesis 1 off as fiction that doesn't match reality, many affirming Christians recognize that the stories set down in this chapter were never meant to catalogue all of creation (in which case, it would just be an encyclopedia), but rather to point us towards God's power and love. Not every microbe and constellation must be named in this chapter in order to have a purpose and a blessing." (HRC)
 - Deuteronomy 22:5, “A woman shall not wear a man's apparel, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whoever does such things is abhorrent to the LORD your God," (NRSV)
   - Generally, a Christian does not believe that Jesus through his life and death fulfilled the requirements of the law of Moses at Mt. Sinai (HRC)

In fact, throughout the Bible examples of people changing their name is common. For example, Jacob in Genesis 32 is told he will now be called Israel, Jesus changes Simon's name to Peter, and Moses changes the name of Hoshea to Joshua.
 - "The Bible establishes a precedent that name changes can be either an uncovering of who God has always seen a person to be, or as the recognition of a new identity and a new beginning." (HRC)

A gender-expansive person of color was welcomed as one of the first Christian converts (Acts 8:26-40) - An Ethiopian eunuch
## Conclusions
 - Let doctors help children make the right decision
    - do NOT prohibit all trans affirming care
 - Athletic and bathroom issues exist outside of trans issues
    - what teams and bathrooms should intersex people use?
    - they should be able, and have been able to choose, this should not be hard to understand
 - Athletics have never been fair
    - those with a genetic advantage win, and it's lauded (Michael Phelps as an example)
    - issues of fairness have always existed, and lines have been drawn. We need to have a GOOD FAITH conversation about redrawing those lines in light of increased trans visibility. NOT ignore their existence with exclusion.

## Research

 > "Privacy laws make it tough to identify the exact number of transgender athletes competing in public school sports, but researcher and medical physicist Joanna Harper estimates the number can't exceed 100 nationwide."  
 > "Gillian Branstetter, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the number of transgender athletes isn't comprehensive, but she's also certain it's a very small portion of the nation's population. Branstetter told Newsweek that Save Women's Sports, an organization advocating for banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports, identified only five transgender athletes competing on girls' teams in school sports for grades K through 12."

 > "On average, 97% of people who are transgender are happy with their decision to transition. Only ~3% of trans people experience some form of regret, but may not detransition. These detransition statistics are for 2022."

 > "While puberty blockers have been scrutinized by some due to their use in caring for transgender children, these drugs have been in use since the 1980s and are overwhelmingly safe if used appropriately. Side effects such as bone health risks typically only occur with prolonged use past the age of puberty."

 > "About 1.03% of the nation's adult population identifies as transgender, according to the Household Pulse Survey.[1] This is equivalent to approximately 2.6 million Americans."

 > "Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (such as sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, hormonal patterns and/or chromosomal patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies. Experts estimate that up to 1.7 percent of the population are born with intersex traits."

 > "God's creation exists in spectrums."  
 > "In between day and night we have dawn and dusk; between land and sea we have coral reefs and estuaries and beaches; between flying birds and swimming fish we have penguins and high jumping dolphins..."  
 > "But rather than writing Genesis 1 off as fiction that doesn't match reality, many affirming Christians recognize that the stories set down in this chapter were never meant to catalogue all of creation (in which case, it would just be an encyclopedia), but rather to point us towards God's power and love. Not every microbe and constellation must be named in this chapter in order to have a purpose and a blessing."  
 > In response to Deuteronomy 22:5 - "The answer for most Christians today would be no, on account of the theological conviction that Jesus, through his life and death, has fulfilled the requirements of the laws Moses presented at Mt. Sinai in the story of Exodus and because they do not believe that maintaining the integrity of God's creation prohibits mixing."  
 > "In fact, the incarnation of God as Jesus, the mixing of the fully divine and the fully human, is often viewed as the necessary context for humanity's salvation altogether."  
 > "To this end, it feels important to lift up the way that Scripture is filled with stories of people having their name changed as well as stories of people changing the name by which they called upon God."  
 > **Ex:** "In Genesis 32 we read of a fearful patriarch, Jacob, on a pilgrimage back to his family from whom he was estranged several years prior as the result of his own wrong-doing. The night before he returns, Jacob is awoken by an attacker, a man whom he wrestles until daybreak leaving him with a displaced hip, a new name and a blessing. Through the violent encounter Jacob is told he will now be called Israel, because he had 'struggled with God and with humans and [had] overcome' (Gen 32:28, NIV)."  
 > **Ex:** "In Numbers 13 we read the story of Moses changing the name of Hoshea, son of Nun, to Joshua, and from there becoming the second-in-command to Moses."  
 > **Ex:** "Similarly, Matthew 16 describes the interaction between Jesus and Simon where his name is changed to Peter, as a signal that he is to be “the rock” and foundation of the church."  
 > "The Bible establishes a precedent that name changes can be either an uncovering of who God has always seen a person to be, or as the recognition of a new identity and a new beginning. These too are important principles at play for many transgender and non-binary people in being able to affirm their gender identities with themselves, with their communities and ultimately with God."
 > "Jesus mentions eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, where he notes that there are many kinds of eunuchs, including 'eunuchs who have been so from birth,' 'eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others,' and 'eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven' (NRSV)... Jesus first of all does not denigrate eunuchs like others in his society may have done, and beyond that he actually lifts eunuchs up as a positive example. The fact that Jesus positively mentions people who are gender-expansive in his own time and place gives hope to many gender-expansive people today."
 > "...in Acts we hear about this Ethiopian eunuch who, after hearing about Jesus, asks Philip 'What is to prevent me from being baptized?' (Acts 8:36, NRSV)... Philip baptizes him with no questions asked and no strings attached. This story of a gender-expansive person of color welcomed as one of the first Christian converts is a powerful part of our spiritual history."
