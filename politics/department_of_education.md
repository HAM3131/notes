# Department of Education

Interest in what the Department of Education does was sparked by a conversation with my Dad about RFK Jr. in early July. Apparently, in a bid to get onto the ballot in some states, he signed a [libertarian pledge](https://www.denverpost.com/2024/07/03/colorado-robert-kennedy-rjk-presidential-ballot-libertarian-party/). Among the obligations in the pledge was a promise to eliminate the Department of Education. Before reading a bit more about this, I didn't know what the DoE did. And I have a feeling that RFK didn't know either.

## What does the DoE do?

Well, what do they do? This is a pretty key question to deciding whether the Department of Education should be eliminated. For starters, according to the DoE in 2024, they have 4,400 employees and a budget of $68 billion. Where does that spending go? Well, according to Frederick Hess, aside from student loans, Pell Grants are the agency's greatest expense ($28 billion a year), followed by Title I funds for high poverty schools ($18 billion a year), and special education funding ($15 billion a year).

Recently, with President Biden's student loan forgiveness programs, an inordinate amount has been spent on student loans--$146 billion in 2023 and a whopping $474 billion in 2022. But in a standard year, far less is spent on this. For the year of 2024, as of July 10th, the agency is on track to spend $20 billion on student loans.
