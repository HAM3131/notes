# Alcohol and Marijuana
As a part of the OSU SALT "The Chase" series, the second week has brought the topic of alcohol and marijuana. I will transcribe my best recollection of the talk from Harrison from my notes, and then give my own response and research after.

## Harrison's Message
At the opening, Harrison begins by talking about how he does not like it when someone who is not an expert talks about something as though they know it. He references a story with him and wife wondering how a crack in their ceiling formed, and both of them who are uneducated in things of that nature guessing for each other why it might have happened.

Overall, Harrison's message as it was directed at the idea of alcohol and drinking was mostly tolerant, including references to the Bible in which alcohol is used as a part of religious experience or confirmed.
 > "Alcohol, when used in moderation, is a gift from God." - Harrison

This emphasis on moderation is constant though, as he references such as Ephesians 5:18 - 
 > "Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,"

Harrison also posed the idea that asking "what does it mean to be drunk" isn't the right question to ask, because asking how close you can get to the boundary set by God is not the line you should be following. He argues that looking at it from this perspective is to perceive God as limiting your enjoyment of alcohol. Instead, your focus should be on the idea that God has presented this boundary not to diminish the joy you can derive from it, but with the intent to help you avoid the negative consequences which come with alcohol.

At this point Harrison shifts the focus of the conversation to marijuana. For a while he talks about the medical effects of marijuana, focusing primarily on how much it's effects can vary by individual. After talking about this for a while, he goes on to make the statement:
 > "...I can't see recreational use of marijuana ever not being a sin." - Harrison

To end the conversation about marijuana, he brings up the fact that there are some who say using marijuana can lead them to spiritual experiences. "However," he says, "the only path closer to God is through Jesus," so there is no way that a substance like marijuana can aid in this respect.

Finally, he pulls back a bit to discuss both substances--alcohol and marijuana--and discourages the usage of both of these by underage people, especially knowing that his audience is college students, many of whom are under 21. He cites the verse Romans 13 for this effect:
 > "Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished." (NLT)
## My Response
I agree overall with what Harrison had to say on alcohol. I think that largely the teachings within the Bible show that alcohol can be just fine, so long as it is not used in excess, and I think that position can be extrapolated a bit to say that what the Bible is trying to prevent when it warns against alcohol is not an inherent property of alcohol itself, it is a negative consequences of drinking too much. Whether that means having your judgement clouded, or something as serious as alcohol poisoning.  

On the other hand, he takes a much less tolerant approach to marijuana, and I think in part that comes from misunderstanding. When Harrison talked about the amount marijuana's effects can vary from person to person, he presented that as though the effects are unpredictable and possibly dangerous. But, at least from my knowledge, the effects of marijuana are well documented, and although they vary from one individual to the next, it's not that we don't know what might happen to them. There are a set of effects that marijuana can have, and some people experience each of them to different degrees. I think it's also interesting to compare that marijuana is less addictive than alcohol (I'm pretty sure) and hasn't been shown to have any negative long-term consequences.  

Finally, I think the call at the end to follow the law, quoting Romans 13:1-2, is not really that effective. It doesn't really say anything about any specific laws and moreso speaks to a general respect for government that people should have, not using Christianity as an excuse to ignore the law. I think this is obvious when you consider how this verse would be interpreted in the hypothetical situation where a modern government had a law against reading the Bible, or in the real situation where the disciples ignored the laws which told them not to preach and spread the word of God.

It gives the evidence that it is possible the common translation of this as "calamus" may be a mistake, and that the real ingredient could in fact be cannabis. This is not certain, but there is a decent case for it.
