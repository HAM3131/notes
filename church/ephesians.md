## Verses to Remember

Ephesians 2:18

## Ephesians 1-3:15

## Ephesians 3
### 16-19
 > "I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God."  

I think here we can see that by accepting the Holy Spirit, your connection with him is strengthened. Once you let him into your heart, you become intertwined with his love inseparably.

### 20-21
 > "Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen."

The power of God is ultimate, and though we may be limited on our own, it is through God when we allow him to work through us that anything can happen. 

## Ephesians 4
### 1-3
 > "Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other’s faults because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace."

Ultimately, though our power is limited, we can choose to embody God with our control of our behavior and strive to be graceful, generous, and loving as he is.

### 4-8
 > "For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future. There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all, in all, and living through all. However, he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity of Christ. That is why the Scriptures say, 'When he ascended to the heights, he led a crowd of captives and gave gifts to his people.'"

When you feel as though you have no "why", God offers that "why" in a unified hope for the future, shared by everything He lives within, the church, it's people, and the world. God is everpresent throughout the world.

### 9-13
 > "Notice that it says 'he ascended.' This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world. And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself. Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ."

So here the gift from God to the church is five things--the `five fold ministry`--and I want to make sure I know what each of them is, so I'll define them here:
 - `Apostles` - Someone who spreads the word of the gospel, including Jesus. In contemporary interpretations, this is more broadly "someone sent on a mission"
 - `Prophets` - A person who speaks for God or by divine inspiration. Again, Jesus and the authors of the Bible.
 - `Evangelists` - Someone who shares the gift of the Gospel and God's word with others who have not heard it.
 - `Pastors` - Someone who interprets scripture for the congregation. Like a pastor herding sheep.
 - `Teachers` - Someone focused on educating others.  

I also find it interesting here that verse 13 says that this will continue until we "[measure] up to the full and complete standard of Christ," contrary to the common notion that it is not possible for a person to live to that standard. What does this mean?

### 14-19
 > "Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love. With the Lord’s authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly confused. Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him. They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity."

The line about maturity shows the way God looks upon us, as a loving father whose children are immature not of any fault of their own, but because in relation to your father how can you be mature. We simply have not had the time to grow in his image.  
The imagery about the body of the church, each part doing it's own special work, also emphasizes and important point in expressing Christianity; As a believer in Christ, you are a part of the church, but there is not one *right* way to perform that belief. In fact, for the whole to be healthy, we must take on different roles, as described in the `five fold ministry.`

### 20-24
 > "But that isn’t what you learned about Christ. Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him, throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy."

It is okay to have sinned before or to have lived in a way that is not holy and righteous by God. God knows that many have led that life, and that is why he provides the Holy Spirit to help you change and be more like Him.

### 25-28
 > "So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts of the same body. And 'don’t sin by letting anger control you.' Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil. If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need."

These are ways in which our past life might be renewed by this "new nature."
