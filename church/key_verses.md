“...[E]very good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit” (Matthew 7:17-18, NRSV).

This can be used to provide a framework for analyzing the teachings and different interpretations of the bible. If the fruits born from one interpretation are harmful and bad, that 'tree' is bad.
